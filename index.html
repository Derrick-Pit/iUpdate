        <h1>iUpdate</h1>

<p>iUpdate is a QT (Mostly C++ with a little HTML an JavaScript) application that can read different files (.csv currently supported) and write the marks into the iEnabler product provided by ITS tertiary software.</p>

<p>iUpdate is open source and free (as in beer and speech). </p>

<p>iUpdate is released under the GNU General Public License </p>

<h2>Link to ITS tertiary software (A Subsidiary of ITS Holdings)</h2>

<p>iUpdate and the current developers is in no way related to ITS tertiary software (A Subsidiary of ITS Holdings). </p>

<p>ITS tertiary software can not be held responsible or liable for iUpdate in any way. </p>

<p>You cannot contact ITS tertiary software for iUpdate support.</p>

<p>iUpdate does not "hack" ITS or use any ITS api.</p>

<p>iUpdate does not connect to the ITS database directly or update any marks directly. </p>

<p>iUpdate should be considered a helper application only. Think of it as running a grease monkey script in Firefox.</p>
