iUpdate
=======

iUpdate is a QT (C++) application that can read different files (.csv currently supported) and write the marks into the iEnabler product provided by ITS tertiary software.

iUpdate is open source and free (as in beer and speech).  


Link to ITS tertiary software (A Subsidiary of ITS Holdings)
------------------------------------------------------------

iUpdate and the current developers is in no way related to ITS tertiary software (A Subsidiary of ITS Holdings). 

ITS tertiary software can not be held responsible or liable for iUpdate in any way. 

You cannot contact ITS tertiary software for iUpdate support.

iUpdate does not "hack" ITS or use any ITS api.

iUpdate does not connect to the ITS database directly or update any marks directly. 

iUpdate should be considered a helper application only. Think of it as running a grease monkey script in Firefox.
